      "Page 1 content: CIBCO CIBC CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH April 26, 2023 Earnings Revision Market Trends Favourable; IFRS 17 Still Presents Many Unknowns Lifecos have outperformed other financials by a good margin year to date. We are somewhat cautious heading into Q1 given the transition to IFRS 17 and lower-than-normal earnings visibility. However, we remain positive on the 12- to 24-month outlook versus banks based on expected EPS growth and capital optionality. The lifecos are trading at 1.3x P/BV on average (IFRS 17 adjusted), in line with the five-year trailing average of 1.3x. Our two Outperformer-rated names are IAG and GWO as we expect both to post strong earnings growth this year. Our investment thesis for the sector is summarized as follows: 1. IFRS 17 reduces near-term earnings visibility. Forecasting 2023 financials and providing a full scope analysis of Q1 results is significantly limited given that 2022 results pro forma IFRS 17 have not been provided by any lifeco. We fully expect some surprises, positive and negative, with Q1 results and believe that forecasting error is higher than normal. Valuations are not discounted to reflect reduced visibility. 2. Market returns to boost wealth & asset management earnings. Q1 was a good quarter for both equity and bond markets. We forecast AUM will increase >3% Q/Q on average and that should provide a nice sequential tailwind to earnings. IFRS 17 will make the full picture of fee- based income more obvious, which is a positive. Industry data shows that long-term fund net sales were negative in Q1 and that might limit the positive reaction to market-driven earnings growth. 3. Investment returns should drive book value growth. The de-linking of assets and liabilities should be a positive for BV this quarter given strong asset returns. Private asset returns will\n",

Excess capital bolstered by IFRS 17. All of the lifecos will receive a capital benefit from the conversion to IFRS 17. Estimated excess capital relative to market cap is 5%-6% for each of GWO, SLF and MFC. IAG is the relative winner with excess capital to market cap at an estimated 20%. IAG bought back 1.2% of stock in Q1 and MFC 0.8%. 5. EPS growth favours lifecos over banks. We are estimating 2023 adjusted EPS growth of 8.5% on average for the lifecos versus roughly zero for the banks. Also, capital deployment represents a potential EPS catalyst for the lifecos. Our estimates imply that GWO and IAG should produce the highest EPS growth this year. Kevin Lai, CFA, CPA, CA +1 647-321-7508 Kevin2.Lai@cibc.com Sector: Financials\n",

Lifeco valuations are no longer discounted, but we believe earnings growth and capital optionality favour the lifecos over banks. We are somewhat cautious heading into Q1 reporting due to the transition to IFRS 17 accounting and what we think are relatively high consensus expectations.

This quarter is unique given that all lifecos under coverage are set to report under the new IFRS 17 framework for the first time. While the accounting change does not impact lifetime cash flows, it will impact the timing of reported income, how that income is presented, and what information must be disclosed to investors. It is too significant a change, in our opinion, to dismiss as a non-event. The stocks have not been discounted for IFRS 17 unknowns, and hence we see additional risk heading into Q1.

      "Page 2 content:  may remain the case for several quarters. Even with IFRS 17, we prefer the lifecos over banks for several reasons. Lifecos have less pro-cyclical earnings and have less credit risk than banks. Current equity market levels are supportive of positive earnings revisions and lifecos generate a higher proportion of earnings from wealth and asset management than the banks. Our estimates suggest the lifecos should generate higher earnings growth over the next year. Most importantly, the lifecos are in a better capital position than banks, which could result in additional EPS upside through either acquisitions or share repurchases. Our Q1 adjusted EPS estimates increase by 1% on average, mostly driven by higher fee income on wealth and asset management assets. We are forecasting average Q1 Y/Y EPS growth of 11.0%, inclusive of IFRS 17 adjustments (adjusting Q1/22 for estimated IFRS 17 impacts). We appear to be below consensus on three of our four names, although we would caution against placing too much emphasis on consensus estimates at this point as it is unclear which brokers have updated estimates to reflect IFRS 17. As we approach earnings, we expect revised earnings estimates to be skewed to the downside. CIBCO\n",

IFRS 17 will see a one-time downward adjustment to book values, mostly as a result of the creation of the contractual service margin (CSM). Removing the translation effects of IFRS 17, book value growth should be solid this quarter given positive returns on equities and bonds, and for GWO, strengthening European currencies. We are forecasting sequential growth of 2.8% on average excluding IFRS 17 impacts. Including IFRS 17 impacts, we estimate BVPS will be down 10.4% Q/Q on average. Given the difference between our BVPS estimates and consensus, it appears to us that consensus estimates for BVPS do not fully incorporate IFRS 17 impacts. Exhibit 3: Canadian Insurers - IFRS 17 Adjusted Book Value Estimates, Q1/22E, Q4/22E And Q1/23E Average: 2.8% 7.6% Source: Company reports and CIBC World Markets Inc. Given that we do not have IFRS 17 results for 2022, we are still modeling on an IFRS 4 basis and then adjusting for expected IFRS 17 impacts per management guidance. This approach opens the possibility for bigger forecasting error and with little to no basis of comparability to analyze the sources of variation.

Based on monthly disclosures from MFS, ending AUM increased 4.1% and average AUM increased 4.8%. Given that MFS runs a high proportion of U.S. equity and EAFE equity mandates, we expect it will post the highest AUM growth of the group. Putnam, which also reports monthly AUM, posted zero growth in average AUM. We estimate an increase in average AUM of 2.6% for IAG and 1.0% for MFC. Correspondingly, we forecast the strongest wealth and asset management earnings growth for SLF and IAG. CIBCO')]\n",
