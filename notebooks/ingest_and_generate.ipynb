(416) 607-3012 . aditya.gupta@desjardins.com Richard Huang, CFA, Associate . (416) 891-7796 . richard.huang@desjardins.com IFRS 17/9 will be adopted in 1Q23 and we expect the quarter to be a trial by fire. The numbers will be useless in our view, given that historical results will not be comparable (2022 was a transition year). Rather, trying to understand the new regime and how the investment community should look at the businesses on a go-forward basis will be more important. Based on what we know: (1) higher equity markets should be good, but lower average AUM (on a year-over-year basis) will put pressure on wealth management results; (2) FX movements had a mixed impact; (3) corporate spreads widened slightly while government yields declined quarter-over-quarter; however, its unclear how this plays out in an IFRS 17 world; and (4) the reopening in Asia should be a positive (for MFC and SLF); however, we do not anticipate an impact until later in 2023. SLF and IAG remain our top two picks (see Exhibit 1). AAR = Above-average Risk Source: Desjardins Capital Markets, FactSet 1. What is managements outlook for 2023/24 for the different businesses under IFRS 17/9? 2. Discussions of certain IFRS 17/9 topics will be a focus (CSM, RA, investment spread, etc). 3. Macro sensitivities under an IFRS 17 world? Only IAG has given details so far. 4. Credit headwinds? We will be looking for updates on balance sheet exposures to in-the-news investments (US/European banks, CRE, etc) and credit trends under IFRS 17/9. Recall that the credit impact will differ based on accounting policy choices. See our IFRS 9 report for more details. 5. Divisional. We can only talk qualitatively. (i) We do not anticipate a big improvement in Asia results (for MFC and SLF). While the reopening of China and Hong Kong is a positive, the benefits likely will not flow through until later in 2023. (ii) Wealth and asset management results were likely weighed down by lower average AUM (for all four on a year-over-year basis). (iii) We expect a good quarter for SLFs US group benefits division. (iv) Any new trends for IAGs US extended vehicle warranty business? (v) How did GWOs European business perform-specifically, under IFRS 17? 6. Policyholder experience. Any new trends? Lapse is always a focus. 7. Regulatory capital. We expect higher LICAT ratios sequentially from the transition to IFRS 17. 8. Dividends. We forecast a ~6% dividend increase by IAG and ~4% increase by SLF. 9. Buybacks. Both MFC and IAG have been buying back stock.

            " Desjardins Exhibit 2 provides 1Q23 conference call dates, times and dial-in numbers. 1 Desjardins core estimates correspond to MFCs and IAGs core earnings definition as well as SLFs underlying earnings definition and GWOs base earnings definition Source: Desjardins Capital Markets, FactSet, company reports Exhibit 3 shows our 1Q23, 2023 and 2024 core EPS estimates vs consensus. Our core estimates now correspond with each companys definition of core, underlying and base earnings. . We made a few small tweaks to our EPS estimates (see Exhibit 3 for details). We are also introducing our 2024 EPS estimates. We acknowledge our deviation from consensus numbers; however, in our view, numbers will not be the focus of the quarter. Instead, the focus will be on determining key performance indicators under the new accounting regime. . Results will not be comparable on a year-over-year basis in 1Q23 given 2022 was a transition year, and so results for 2022 will not be indicative of future trends (so weve been told by all of the lifecos). With that being said, we expect MFCs and SLFs Asia businesses to show some improvement (eg in terms of sales), and more so in 2H23 as restrictions ease. For the wealth management businesses, we expect results to be tempered by lower average wealth or asset management AUM (on a year-over-year basis). The US dollar depreciated slightly quarter-over- quarter vs the Canadian dollar on an average basis (relevant for all lifecos), while the British pound and euro appreciated vs the Canadian dollar (pound and euro relevant for GWO). · Our numbers are predicated on IFRS 17 guidelines, based on what we know right now. Despite various headwinds, there are several earnings growth drivers for each company for 2023, including: (1) SLF-contribution from the DentaQuest (DQ) acquisition, potential turnaround in Asia and SLC Management; (2) MFC-potential turnaround in Asia and buybacks; (3) IAG- potential turnaround in US auto sales (implications for its US extended vehicle warranty business), organic growth, digital initiatives, buybacks and leveraging distribution capabilities domestically; and (4) GWO-addition of MassMutuals and Prudentials US retirement businesses.
