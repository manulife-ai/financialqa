For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, base earnings per common share were $3.94 compared to $3.56 a year ago, an increase of 11%, reflecting strong business growth and positive investment returns. 2023 base earnings of $3,667 million were up $349 million or 11% compared to 2022 base earnings of $3,318 million. The increase in base earnings year-over-year was driven by organic growth at Empower, the impact of higher average equity markets on net fee and spread income as well as an additional quarter of Prudential-related earnings in the U.S. segment. Higher base earnings in the Capital and Risk Solutions segment was mainly the result of higher structured reinsurance business earnings and a provision for estimated claims related to Hurricane Ian of $128 million in 2022.• For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, net earnings per common share decreased 24% to $2.94 compared to the previous year. Market experience relative to expectations decreased by $837 million to negative $307 million compared to 2022, primarily due to large interest rate increases in 2022 which had a significant positive impact. 2023 results also included net business transformation charges and realized losses on the sale of surplus assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, primarily in the Europe and U.S. segments.· For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, Lifeco\\'s combined quarterly dividends paid to common shareholders increased by 6% to $2.08 per share.· The Company maintained its strong capital position as evidenced by a Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test (LICAT) Ratio at December 31, 2023 of 128% for Canada Life, Lifeco\\'s major operating subsidiary, which exceeded the OSFI Supervisory Target Total Ratio of 100%, and Supervisory Minimum Total Ratio of 90%. In conjunction with the transition to IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, the Company made certain asset liability matching (ALM) and accounting policy choices to increase the stability of regulatory capital. As a result, Canada Life\\'s LICAT ratio demonstrated increased stability throughout 2023.· The Company\\'s financial leverage ratio at December 31, 2023 was 30% compared to 33% in the previous year. This reduction is due to an increase in equity and the repayment of a temporary US$500 million increase in short-term debt financing used to fund the acquisition of the retirement services business of Prudential as well as the repayment of the principal amount of its maturing 2.50% €500 million senior bonds, together with accrued interest.Medium-Term Financial ObjectivesThe Company measures performance against its medium-term financial objectives, with medium-term defined as 3 to 5 years. The Company aims to create value through disciplined capital deployment to achieve, over the medium-term, 8-10% base EPS growth per annum, 16-17% base return on equity (ROE) and to deliver strong cash generation.The Company has also stated its objective to achieve base earnings growth in Empower of 15-20% in 2024.Medium-Term Financial Objectives1-Year Base15-Year Base 1,28-10% base EPS growth per annum111%11% CAGR1 This metric is a non-GAAP ratio. Refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Ratios\" section of this document for additional details.2 2018 base earnings were calculated by excluding items from net earnings as discussed in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Ratios\" section of the Company\\'s Q4 2023 MD&A. In addition, the Company excluded earnings related to the business transferred to Protective Life under an indemnity reinsurance agreement in 2019 to provide a more accurate comparison for the 5-year growth rate. 2018 base earnings were $2,380 million and base earnings per share was $2.41 compared to net earnings of $2,961 million and net earnings per share of $3.00. Items excluded from 2018 base earnings included a positive impact on actuarial assumption changes and management actions of $616 million, a positive impact on market-related impacts on liabilities of $29 million, restructuring costs of $56 million, a legal accrual of $13 million, a net benefit on tax legislative impacts of $5 million and $135 million of earnings related to the business transferred to Protective Life. For purposes of calculating the 5-year growth rate for base EPS under IFRS 17, amortization of acquisition related finite life intangible assets of $41 million after-tax was added back to 2018 base earnings. With this adjustment, 2018 base earnings were $2,286 million and base EPS of $2.31.3 This is the 2-year average base ROE under IFRS 17. The 3-year average base ROE under IFRS 4 is 14%. The prior base ROE medium-term objective was 14% - 15% under IFRS 4.2023 DevelopmentsAs the Company is advancing its business strategy and driving momentum across the portfolio, it is enhancing its reporting and disclosures to provide greater clarity and transparency into how the Company is creating value for shareholders and growing the business. The result is that the Company is evolving the previous value-creation priorities to focus on three key value drivers for its business: Workplace Solutions, Wealth & Asset Management and Insurance & Risk Solutions.Strategic Highlights and TransactionsThe Company announced the following strategic business actions to add scale, grow and extend the Company\\'s businesses.United States· Subsequent to December 31, 2023, on January 1, 2024, Lifeco completed the previously announced sale of Putnam Investments to Franklin Resources, Inc., operating as \"Franklin Templeton\", in exchange for Franklin Templeton common shares, cash, and other deferred and contingent consideration. The transaction is not expected to have a material financial impact for Lifeco at close and will be reflected in the first quarter 2024 results. Lifeco will retain its controlling interest in PanAgora Asset Management, a leading quantitative asset manager, and has agreed to retain shares representing approximately 4.9% of outstanding Franklin Templeton stock for a minimum 5-year period.Great-West Lifeco Inc. 2023 Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis6', 'page_num': 7}\n",

Net earnings also include the earnings from Putnam Investments reported as discontinued operations.With the adoption of IFRS 17, the Company refined the definition of base earnings (loss) in the first quarter of 2023 with application to 2022 comparative results for an updated representation of the Company\\'s underlying business performance, as well as to enhance consistency and comparability with financial services industry peers.For the three months endedFor the twelve months endedDec. 31 2023Sept. 30 2023Dec. 31 2022 (Restated)Dec. 31 2023Dec. 31 2022 (Restated)1 This metric is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The increase was primarily due to strong group disability results driven by improved morbidity experience and management pricing actions and higher earnings on surplus in the Canada segment, an increase in fee and other income due to organic growth in the U.S. segment and new business growth and net favourable experience in the Capital and Risk Solutions segment. These items were partially offset by higher taxes and by lower investment earnings driven by the impact of trading activity in the prior year that did not re-occur in the Europe segment.For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, Lifeco\\'s base earnings were $3,667 million ($3.94 per common share) compared to $3,318 million ($3.56 per common share) a year ago. The 11% increase was primarily due an additional quarter of Prudential-related earnings in the U.S. segment and a provision for estimated claims related to Hurricane Ian of $128 million in 2022, as well as the same reasons discussed for the in-quarter results.Great-West Lifeco Inc. 2023 Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis10', 'page_num': 11}\n",

            " {'text': 'Management\\'s Discussion and AnalysisNet EarningsLifeco\\'s net earnings from continuing operations for the three month period ended December 31, 2023 of $743 million ($0.80 per common share) increased by $265 million or 55% compared to $478 million ($0.51 per common share) a year ago. The increase was primarily due to a $127 million net gain on a sale of a portfolio of policies to AIB Life and a $110 million net gain from the recapture impact on a reinsured block of inforce annuities in the Europe segment, more favourable market experience relative to expectations in the Europe and Capital and Risk Solutions segments, and an increase in base earnings. These items were partially offset by unfavourable market value impacts in Canada driven primarily by a decrease in long-term interest rates. The results from discontinued operations were a net loss of $3 million compared to a net loss of $26 million a year ago.For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, Lifeco\\'s net earnings from continuing operations were $2,862 million ($2.94 per common share) compared to $3,628 million ($3.89 per common share) a year ago. In conjunction with the transition to IFRS 17, the Company made ALM and accounting policy choices to increase the stability of regulatory capital. As a result, a certain amount of additional net earnings sensitivity was accepted in order to balance LICAT capital sensitivity, resulting in more stable capital positions. Over the time frame since transition, cumulative fluctuations in net earnings from continuing operations driven by market experience relative to expectations have been modest and regulatory capital has experienced increased stability, consistent with Management\\'s expectations. For additional information, refer to the \"Transition to IFRS 17 and IFRS 9\" section of this document. The 21% decrease was primarily due to market experience relative to expectations of negative $307 million, a decrease of $837 million compared to last year, due to large increases in interest rates in 2022 which had a significant positive earnings impact. In addition, there were realized losses on the sale of surplus assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) to improve regulatory capital positioning in the Europe segment. These items were partially offset by an increase in base earnings, the net gain on sale to AIB Life and the inforce annuity reinsurance recapture as discussed for the in-quarter results. The results from discontinued operations were a net loss of $124 million compared to a net loss of $32 million a year ago predominantly due to transaction costs.Lifeco\\'s net earnings from continuing operations for the three month period ended December 31, 2023 of $743 million ($0.80 per common share) decreased by $193 million or 21% compared to $936 million ($1.01 per common share) in the previous quarter. The decrease was primarily due to unfavourable market experience relative to expectations in the Canada and Capital and Risk Solutions segments as well as provisions for restructuring costs in the Europe segment. These items were partially offset by the net gain on sale to AIB Life and the inforce annuity reinsurance recapture as discussed above as well as an increase in base earnings. The results from discontinued operations were a net loss of $3 million compared to $31 million in the previous quarter.Items Excluded from Base Earnings Market Experience Relative to ExpectationsFor the three months endedFor the twelve months endedDec. 31 2023Sept. 30 2023Dec. 31 2022 (Restated)Dec. 31 2023Dec. 31 2022 (Restated)Market experience relative to expectations, which are reflected in the net investment result of the Company\\'s consolidated statement of earnings, negatively impacted net earnings by $213 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 (negative impact of $386 million in the fourth quarter of 2022). In-quarter impacts reflect interest rate movements including spread movements, lower returns than expected on real estate assets, partially offset by higher returns on public equities. The negative interest rate and spread movement impacts primarily arose from liabilities increasing by more than their supporting assets in the Canada, Europe, and Capital and Risk Solutions segments. The lower returns than expected on real estate and other non-fixed income assets arose on real estate assets in the U.K. and Canada. The higher returns on public equities were primarily from assets held in Canada.For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, market experience relative to expectations negatively impacted net earnings by $307 million (positive impact of $530 million year-to-date in 2022). The 2023 year-to-date negative impact was primarily due to lower returns than expected on real estate assets.In order to mitigate the Company\\'s exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Company follows disciplined processes for matching asset and liability cash flows. As a result, the impact of changing interest rates is mostly mitigated in the current period, with the impact of changes in fair values of bonds backing insurance contract liabilities mostly offset by a corresponding change in the insurance contract liabilities. However, differences in the interest rate sensitivity in the value of assets and the value of insurance and investment contract liabilities leads to a sensitivity to interest rate movements in net earnings under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, due to the Company\\'s asset liability management strategies and accounting policy choices. These choices include consideration of the impact on regulatory capital, which can result in increased net earnings sensitivity, but decreased capital sensitivity. For example, the Company\\'s asset liability management strategy uses equities and other non-fixed income assets as a component of general fund assets supporting liabilities, which leads to interest rate exposure in the net earnings; and the classification of financial assets under IFRS 9, for example, mortgage assets which are valued at amortized cost and held in the general fund assets supporting liabilities, also contributes to interest rate exposure in net earnings. These exposures are designed to help offset interest rate sensitivity and volatility in the LICAT capital calculation, resulting in decreased capital sensitivity. Furthermore, sensitivities to interest rate movements vary depending upon the geography where the changes occur and the level of change in interest rates by term.Great-West Lifeco Inc. 2023 Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis11', 'page_num': 12}\n"
