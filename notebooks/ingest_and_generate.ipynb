That said, the underlying economics and performance of the lifecos business units have not changed and, while under IFRS 17, earnings are anticipated to be more stable quarter to quarter, we still anticipate the push and pulls of capital market factors to impact earnings. We expect to see reasonably strong sales for the groups North American and European operations, as well as a rebound in Asia as many pandemic restrictions were eased and traffic to Hong Kong from Mainland China showed significant improvement in the quarter1. For the lifecos wealth operations, we anticipate an improvement in flows given the continued strong equity markets, however, we note that, while equity markets ended the quarter higher, they were volatile during the quarter and we anticipate continued pressure on the groups asset management operations given the impact of volatility on average asset levels. We anticipate core earnings for the group to gain 7% on a year- over-year basis and give back 7% from a strong fourth quarter (both against the previous accounting scheme). While markets rallied across the globe, bond yields declined, and movements in both corporate spreads and swap spreads were mixed. The shape of the yield curve remains a concern, prolonging what has been a challenging operating environment for the Canadian lifecos. FIGURE 1.

Stock Rating: OW: Overweight; EW: Equal Weight; UW: Underweight; Industry view: Positive During the quarter, bond yields declined on both sides of the border driven by a change in the pace of rate hikes from both the Fed and the Bank of Canada. While inflation remains elevated, it has moderated since the middle of last year. Additionally, banking problems south of the border surfaced during the quarter, causing the Fed to get creative and ensure ample liquidity for the banking system. This, combined with a slower pace of rate hikes (in fact a full-blown pause in rate hikes in Canada), drove rate expectations lower, with markets now expecting rate cuts on the horizon. Employment remains robust and while economic activity has moderated, growth remains positive and labour markets remain tight in both Canada and the U.S .. That said, the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to weigh on global sentiment and some investors fear that the banking problems could spread. Another concern is that the full economic implications of the war are still uncertain, and a resurgence in COVID cases could fuel further inflation and supply chain issues. Both the Fed and the Bank of Canada increased policy rates and continued implementation of quantitative tightening but they hiked rates at a slower pace and, while the Fed has only discussed the potential for a pivot in policy from rate hiking to a pause in rates, the Bank of', 'page_num': 5, 'company_name': 'Barclays', 'report_quarter': 'Q1', 'report_blob_path': 'https://eliasstorage2.blob.core.windows.net/messiah-test/Barclays_Preview_Q1.pdf', 'page_titles': 'Mixed Capital Market Factors and New Accounting Standard to Muddy First Quarter Earnings', 'page_headers': 'Barclays | L&H Insurers', 'section_headers': '', 'page_footers': '13 April 2023'}\n"

            " Net investment result shows the relationship between net investment income earned from managing the Companys financial assets and the impact of insurance finance income or expenses, including the effects of discount rates and other financial variables on valuing the Companys insurance contract liabilities. Base earnings - net investment result represents: (i) the difference between managements expected return on assets backing insurance contract liabilities and the unwinding of discount rates used to measure corresponding insurance contract liabilities, (ii) the impact of credit experience arising from upgrades, downgrades and impairments on assets held to back insurance contract liabilities and changes in expected credit losses on assets supporting surplus, (iii) the impact of trading activity on fixed income asset portfolios supporting liabilities, and (iv) expected investment income on surplus assets net of associated investment expenses. For the three months ended For the twelve months ended Dec. 31 2023 Sept. 30 2023 Dec. 31 2022 Dec. 31 2023 Dec. 31 2022 1 Comparative results are restated to exclude net investment result from discontinued operations related to Putnam Investments. Base earnings net investment result in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by $52 million compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to credit-related impairments of commercial mortgage loans in the U.S. segment and the favourable impact of trading activity in the Europe segment in the prior year that did not repeat. These items were partially offset by the favourable impact of trading activity in the Canada segment and higher earnings on surplus income in the Canada and Europe segments. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, base earnings net investment result increased by $98 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher earnings on surplus in all segments, partially offset by less favourable impacts on liabilities compared to their supporting assets driven by a rise in interest rates, lower equity release mortgage origination fees and the favourable impact of trading activity in the Europe segment in the prior year that did not repeat. Credit experience impacts on net earnings can arise from: · upgrades, downgrades and impairments on fixed income assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), which support insurance contract liabilities; · impairments on assets measured at FVTPL, which support general account investment products; and · the change in expected credit losses on assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and amortized cost. Credit markets impact on common shareholders net earnings (pre-tax) For the three months ended For the twelve months ended Dec. 31 2023 Sept. 30 2023 Dec. 31 2022 Dec. 31 2023 Dec. 31 2022 In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company experienced net negative $47 million of credit-related experience in net investment result (net negative impact of $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2022), primarily due to credit charges on mortgage loans in the U.S. segment. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company experienced net negative $84 million of credit-related experience in net investment result (net negative impact of $25 million in 2022), primarily due to credit charges on mortgage loans and bonds in the U.S. segment as well as the net remeasurement of allowance for expected credit losses on mortgage loans in the Europe segment.\n",
