(LNC) Q1 2023 Earnings Call C Corrected Transcript 10-May-2023 from those stress tests and the estimated potential credit loss and ratings migration impacts on capital in a stressed scenario. Ellen Gail Cooper President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Lincoln National Corp. A Sure. So Ill take that question as well. So we have been talking for some time, first of all, about the fact that our investment portfolio, overall credit quality has been improving. And we saw, as Chris mentioned, the seventh consecutive quarter now of net positive ratings migration. We also have talked about the fact that we utilize a multi-manager framework across the entire portfolio. And so we leverage our external managers and their very professional advice in terms of how we think about potential scenarios and stress testing for particular economic scenarios. And so in those particular cases, we will go sector-by-sector, we will go name-by-name, and we will stress test, and we will then evaluate potential names and potential credits that may experience significant credit deterioration in the event of a credit cycle. And as a result of that, over the last five to six years, weve done some very significant de-risking and also shifts in terms of the overall portfolio. So, one of the things that we highlighted this morning was within our commercial mortgage loans. And Ill come back to how were stress testing that in a moment. But just to give you a sense of how this has worked in terms of the overall shift. So over the last couple of years we have been shifting, first of all, away from public corporates. We have increased the overall credit quality, so if you look year-over-year, our single A and above has increased by about 200 basis points, and the decrease has come from, we have a lower allocation now to overall BBBs and within there, the lowest allocation that weve ever had the BBB- and BBB- is on negative outlook, and our below investment grade has also decreased by about another 100 basis points. And weve shifted out of cyclical sectors that tend to not hold up well during an economic cycle. In the mortgage portfolio, in particular, there, some of what we have done is that we have been shifting into industrial, in particular, and weve increased our overall industrial exposure inside of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio, by about 600 basis points and a negative 400 basis points, as Chris highlighted, away from office and another about minus 200 basis points as it relates to retail. As it relates to overall credit, stress testing in the commercial mortgage loan portfolio, here as well, we stress test this portfolio on a loan-level basis. And what we do is we evaluate the most recent financial statements. We look at the rent rolls for each of the properties. We stress net operating income by property type. And for office, in particular, we used actual rent rolls, actual lease renewal assumptions that were derived from our overall portfolio surveillance activities. And we add that all up together, and we are extremely comfortable and believe that any particular credit stress as it relates to the overall portfolio to CML or to office is extremely manageable and will keep us in line with our overall financial plan and all of the expectations that we have previously communicated to you. Operator: Next, well go to Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.

We use a number of non-GAAP and other financial measures to evaluate overall performance and to assess each of our businesses. This section includes information required by National Instrument 52-112 - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure in respect of \"specified financial measures\" (as defined therein). Non-GAAP financial measures include core earnings (loss); core earnings available to common shareholders; core earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"core EBITDA\"); transitional net income (loss) attributed to shareholders (\"Transitional Net Income\"); common shareholders transitional net income; adjusted book value; post-tax contractual service margin; post-tax contractual service margin net of NCI (\"post-tax CSM net of NCI\"); and core revenue. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures include the following stated on a constant exchange rate (\"CER\") basis: any of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures; net income attributed to shareholders; and common shareholders net income. Non-GAAP ratios include core return on common shareholders equity (\"core ROE\"); diluted core earnings per common share (\"core EPS\"); transitional diluted earnings per common share (\"transitional EPS\"); transitional return on equity (\"transitional ROE\"); adjusted book value per common share; core EBITDA margin; and percentage growth/decline on a constant exchange rate basis in any of the above non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios; net income attributed to shareholders; diluted earnings per common share (\"EPS\"), CSM net of NCI, and new business CSM. Other specified financial measures include remittances; NBV; APE sales; gross flows; net flows; average assets under management and administration (\"average AUMA\"); and percentage growth/decline in these foregoing specified financial measures. In addition, explanations of the components of the CSM movement, other than the new business CSM were provided in the 2023 MD&A. Non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios are not standardized financial measures under GAAP and, therefore, might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers. Therefore, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any other financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For more information on non-GAAP financial measures, including those referred to above, see the section \"Non-GAAP and other financial measures\" in our 2023 MD&A, which is incorporated by reference. IFRS 17 Transition Manulife adopted IFRS 17 \"Insurance Contracts\" and IFRS 9 \"Financial Instruments\" effective for years beginning on January 1, 2023, to be applied retrospectively. Our quarterly and full year 2022 results have been restated in accordance with IFRS 17 and IFRS 9. The 2022 comparative results in this news release may not be fully representative of our market risk profile, as the transition of our general fund portfolio for asset-liability matching purposes under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 was not completed until early 2023. Consequently, year-over-year variations between our 2023 results compared to the 2022 results should be viewed in this context. 8', 'page_num': 8}\n",
