For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, base earnings per common share were $3.94 compared to $3.56 a year ago, an increase of 11%, reflecting strong business growth and positive investment returns. 2023 base earnings of $3,667 million were up $349 million or 11% compared to 2022 base earnings of $3,318 million. The increase in base earnings year-over-year was driven by organic growth at Empower, the impact of higher average equity markets on net fee and spread income as well as an additional quarter of Prudential-related earnings in the U.S. segment. Higher base earnings in the Capital and Risk Solutions segment was mainly the result of higher structured reinsurance business earnings and a provision for estimated claims related to Hurricane Ian of $128 million in 2022.• For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, net earnings per common share decreased 24% to $2.94 compared to the previous year. Market experience relative to expectations decreased by $837 million to negative $307 million compared to 2022, primarily due to large interest rate increases in 2022 which had a significant positive impact. 2023 results also included net business transformation charges and realized losses on the sale of surplus assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, primarily in the Europe and U.S. segments.· For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, Lifeco\\'s combined quarterly dividends paid to common shareholders increased by 6% to $2.08 per share.· The Company maintained its strong capital position as evidenced by a Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test (LICAT) Ratio at December 31, 2023 of 128% for Canada Life, Lifeco\\'s major operating subsidiary, which exceeded the OSFI Supervisory Target Total Ratio of 100%, and Supervisory Minimum Total Ratio of 90%. In conjunction with the transition to IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, the Company made certain asset liability matching (ALM) and accounting policy choices to increase the stability of regulatory capital. As a result, Canada Life\\'s LICAT ratio demonstrated increased stability throughout 2023.· The Company\\'s financial leverage ratio at December 31, 2023 was 30% compared to 33% in the previous year. This reduction is due to an increase in equity and the repayment of a temporary US$500 million increase in short-term debt financing used to fund the acquisition of the retirement services business of Prudential as well as the repayment of the principal amount of its maturing 2.50% €500 million senior bonds, together with accrued interest.Medium-Term Financial ObjectivesThe Company measures performance against its medium-term financial objectives, with medium-term defined as 3 to 5 years. The Company aims to create value through disciplined capital deployment to achieve, over the medium-term, 8-10% base EPS growth per annum, 16-17% base return on equity (ROE) and to deliver strong cash generation.The Company has also stated its objective to achieve base earnings growth in Empower of 15-20% in 2024.Medium-Term Financial Objectives1-Year Base15-Year Base 1,28-10% base EPS growth per annum111%11% CAGR1 This metric is a non-GAAP ratio. Refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Ratios\" section of this document for additional details.2 2018 base earnings were calculated by excluding items from net earnings as discussed in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Ratios\" section of the Company\\'s Q4 2023 MD&A. In addition, the Company excluded earnings related to the business transferred to Protective Life under an indemnity reinsurance agreement in 2019 to provide a more accurate comparison for the 5-year growth rate. 2018 base earnings were $2,380 million and base earnings per share was $2.41 compared to net earnings of $2,961 million and net earnings per share of $3.00. Items excluded from 2018 base earnings included a positive impact on actuarial assumption changes and management actions of $616 million, a positive impact on market-related impacts on liabilities of $29 million, restructuring costs of $56 million, a legal accrual of $13 million, a net benefit on tax legislative impacts of $5 million and $135 million of earnings related to the business transferred to Protective Life. For purposes of calculating the 5-year growth rate for base EPS under IFRS 17, amortization of acquisition related finite life intangible assets of $41 million after-tax was added back to 2018 base earnings. With this adjustment, 2018 base earnings were $2,286 million and base EPS of $2.31.3 This is the 2-year average base ROE under IFRS 17. The 3-year average base ROE under IFRS 4 is 14%. The prior base ROE medium-term objective was 14% - 15% under IFRS 4.2023 DevelopmentsAs the Company is advancing its business strategy and driving momentum across the portfolio, it is enhancing its reporting and disclosures to provide greater clarity and transparency into how the Company is creating value for shareholders and growing the business. The result is that the Company is evolving the previous value-creation priorities to focus on three key value drivers for its business: Workplace Solutions, Wealth & Asset Management and Insurance & Risk Solutions.Strategic Highlights and TransactionsThe Company announced the following strategic business actions to add scale, grow and extend the Company\\'s businesses.United States· Subsequent to December 31, 2023, on January 1, 2024, Lifeco completed the previously announced sale of Putnam Investments to Franklin Resources, Inc., operating as \"Franklin Templeton\", in exchange for Franklin Templeton common shares, cash, and other deferred and contingent consideration. The transaction is not expected to have a material financial impact for Lifeco at close and will be reflected in the first quarter 2024 results. Lifeco will retain its controlling interest in PanAgora Asset Management, a leading quantitative asset manager, and has agreed to retain shares representing approximately 4.9% of outstanding Franklin Templeton stock for a minimum 5-year period.Great-West Lifeco Inc. 2023 Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis6', 'page_num': 7}\n",
